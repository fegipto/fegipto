- 💻 Repositories: you can take a look at some of my projects
  - [Democracia2](https://github.com/fegipto/CSS-Project---Democracia2): This project was developed on a subject of the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The main idea was to create a software that had many properties such as security, privacy, performance scalability, integration with other government systems, etc. The project consisted of building a software where people could vote in order to reduce the amount of abstention. Technologies used: Java, JavaFX, HTML, JUnit, Spring, JPA, Docker and Postgres.
  - [Game Store](https://github.com/fegipto/PSI-Project---Game-Store): This project was developed on a subject of the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The main idea was to create a system which gives more visibility to the products and allows for a bigger interaction between its players. To complete this project, it was fundamental to follow a software development methodology inspired in the Kanban methodology. Technologies used: Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MongoDB.
  - [Tintolmarket](https://github.com/fegipto/SC-Project---Tintolmarket): This project was developed on a subject of the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The main idea was to develop a wine shop. The project was divided in 2 phases: On the first phase, the functionalities of the service were developed, leaving the web application functional, however, with no security. On the second one, the security aspects were taken into account so that the interactions and the whole system were safe. Technologies used: Java and Gradle.
  - [SD Project](https://github.com/fegipto/SD-Project): This project was developed on a subject of the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. The main idea was to make a key-value pair storage service similar to the one used by Amazon to support its web services. This way, the data structure used to store this information was a binary-search tree given its high efficiency on the search level. Technologies used: C, Apache ZooKeeper, and Makefile.
